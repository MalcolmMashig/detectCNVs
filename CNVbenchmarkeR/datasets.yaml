# define which datasets will be evaluated in the benchmark 

# This is an example of dataset definition:
dataset1:
  include: true   # true to include this dataset in the analysis, false otherwise
  bams_dir: "/Users/malcolm_mashig/local/school/ms/2022-spring/genomics/project/benchmarkCNVs/bam"   # folder where bams files (.bai indexes) are stored
  bed_file: "/Users/malcolm_mashig/local/school/ms/2022-spring/genomics/project/benchmarkCNVs/bed/41431_2020_675_MOESM7_ESM.bed"   # bed file defining ROIs. It must be sortered by chr and start position, and 4th column must contain only gene symbol. (See examples folder)
  fasta_file: "/Users/malcolm_mashig/local/school/ms/2022-spring/genomics/project/benchmarkCNVs/fasta/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13_genomic.fasta"   # genome fasta file

  validated_results_file_format: "icr"   # format of validated results file: icr or panelcn
  read_length: 101   # read length used when sequencing
