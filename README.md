# What ExomeDepth does

ExomeDepth is a R package designed to detect inherited copy number variants (CNVs) using high throughput sequence data.

# Build instructions

``` bash
make build
```

should create the relevant version of the ExomeDepth package and build.

Note that a slightly modified version of ExomeDepth is also used inside another CNV detection packaged called  DECoN.
